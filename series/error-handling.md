# Error Handling

- Internal error handling.
- the same way as handling return statements: errors and return statements both stop the evaluation of a series of statements.

## Final words & Resources

If you didn't have the opportunity, take a look at the posts from the [Building an Interpreter series](https://leandrotk.github.io/series/building-an-interpreter/):

- [Building an Interpreter: Lexical Analysis - Part 1](https://leandrotk.github.io/series/building-an-interpreter/building-an-interpreter-lexical-analysis-part-1.html)
- [Building an Interpreter: Lexical Analysis - Part 2](https://leandrotk.github.io/series/building-an-interpreter/building-an-interpreter-lexical-analysis-part-2.html)
- [Building an Interpreter: Lexical Analysis - Part 3](https://leandrotk.github.io/series/building-an-interpreter/building-an-interpreter-lexical-analysis-part-3.html)
- [Building an Interpreter: REPL](https://leandrotk.github.io/series/building-an-interpreter/building-an-interpreter-repl.html)

These are the resources I'm using to learn more about this field:

- [monkey-ts](https://github.com/leandrotk/monkey-ts): the open-source project of the compiler for the TypeScript version of the Monkey programming language.
- [Programming Language Theory](https://github.com/leandrotk/programming-language-theory): a bunch of resources about my studies on Programming Language Theory & Applied PLT.
- [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32681092-writing-an-interpreter-in-go): the book I'm reading to learn and implement the Monkey compiler.
